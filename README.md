{# CaptionCraft AI

## Project Description

CaptionCraft AI is a mobile application designed to generate high-quality social media captions using the Google Gemini Flash 2 API. The application supports multiple platforms, including Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, and Facebook. Users can input a theme, target audience, and desired tone (e.g., funny, professional, persuasive), and the app will produce 3â€“5 caption variations optimized for engagement.

## Core Features

-   **Input Configuration**: Simple input fields for theme, target audience, tone, and platform (Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Facebook).
-   **AI Caption Generation**: Generates 3-5 caption variations using the Google Gemini Flash 2 API based on user input.
-   **Caption Display and Actions**: Displays generated captions in a scrollable list with options to copy, save, and regenerate.
-   **Save Captions**: Allows users to save favorite captions for later use, organized by platform and theme.
-   **Performance Feedback**: AI-powered tool that analyzes caption performance and provides suggestions for improvement.
